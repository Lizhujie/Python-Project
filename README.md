# Python-Project(Kaggle_Game prediction)
## Overview
The mobile games industry is worth billions of dollars, with companies spending vast amounts of money on the development and marketing of these games to an equally large market. Using this data set, insights can be gained into a sub-market of this market, strategy games.
## Background
This is the data of 17007 strategy games on the Apple App Store. It was collected on the 3rd of August 2019, using the iTunes API and the App Store sitemap.
## Project Overview
    1.Dataset Structure and read
    2.Data Visualization and clean(Panda and Seaborn)
    3.Feature Engineering
    4.Model Optimization and ensemble(RandomForest, GradientBoosting, Xgboost), Final stacking
    5.Prediction and Compare different means
## Conclusion
        Based on the Game information to predict is this game can make a success. It can give the rate of game and estimate whether the game is a great game.
        Although because of so many empty values of the most important part, the accuracy is not perfect, the model can do a acceptable prediction.
